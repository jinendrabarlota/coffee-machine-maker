☕ Coffee Machine Maker
A Python project that simulates a coffee machine! This project allows users to choose from various coffee options, manage resources like water and coffee beans, and even check the machine's financial status. Perfect for learning about Python functions, classes, and logic implementation.

Features
Menu Options: Offers different coffee options (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino).
Resource Management: Tracks the remaining water, milk, coffee, and cups.
Financial Tracking: Calculates and displays earnings from coffee sales.
Interactive Interface: Allows users to make coffee, refill resources, and check the machine’s status through a command-line interface.
Modular Design: Built using Python functions and/or classes for easy extension.

How It Works
The user is prompted with a menu of available coffee options.
The machine checks if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee.
The user inserts "coins" (simulated in the program) to pay for the coffee.
The machine dispenses the coffee, updates resources, and adds earnings to the machine's balance.

Technologies Used
Python: The entire project is implemented in Python, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

Learning Outcomes
Gain experience in working with Python functions and classes.
Understand the basics of resource and state management in programming.
Learn how to build a text-based interactive application.

Future Improvements
Add more coffee options to the menu.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
Allow users to save and load machine states.
Integrate with a database to track long-term usage.
